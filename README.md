# SOLID in Go

Implement SOLID principle in Go

#### Single Responsibility Principle

- A type should only have one reason to change
- Separation of concerns - different types/packages handling different, independent task/problems

#### Openâ€“closed Principle

- Types should be open for extension but closed for modification

#### Liskov Substitution Principle

- Types should be able to substitute an embedding type in place of its embedded part

#### Interface Segregation Principle

- Don't put too much into an interface; split into separate interfaces
- YAGNI - You Ain't Going to Need It

#### Dependency Inversion Principle

- High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstractions
